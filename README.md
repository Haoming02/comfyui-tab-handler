# ComfyUI Tab Handler
This is an Extension for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), which intercepts the default browser behavior when pressing `Tab` key to focus the `textarea` instead.

## But Why
By default, **ComfyUI** does not handle the `Tab` key. So when you press `Tab`, it may start highlighting other buttons or elements. Use this extension to force it to switch between the `textarea` *(**i.e.** prompt field)*.
